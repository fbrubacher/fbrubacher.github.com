title: Speaking at the RubyConf Uruguay

p(meta). Nov 5, 2010 - Montevideo

Without a doubt one of the best experiences this year was hosting the
local version of RubyConf and being able to speak alongside great
speakers like Charles Nutter, Aaron Patterson and Brian Ford.

It was really a humbling experience and one that i would love to
repeat sometime in the future. My talk was about introducing Clojure
for Rubysts. Actually it was an ode to functional programming, which
in case you have following my blog is one of my passions. And i think
at least i got the attention of a couple of programmers on doing
things differently or why imperative programming is the new spaghetti
code :).

Other highlights of the conference were the talks of Michel
Martens (Soveran), the talk of Brian Ford and for sure the one of
Charles Nutter. Charles is an all around very knowledgeable guy and a
very nice guy. It was really great being able to speak with him, and
to discuss about actos/agents and other concurrency stuff. One thing
that let me down, I heard lots of people bashing JRuby, I really it is
really lame when people hate anything J related because they can't
stand a language (Java).

But in conclusion a great weekend.
