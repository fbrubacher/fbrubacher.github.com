title: Speaking at the Euruko 2011
---

This year I was fortunate enough to travel to Berlin to give a talk in
Euruko. Thanks to Cubox SA (my employer) for supporting my trip,  and Euruko Germany
team for having me. The experience was awesome all in all. It was the
first conference that I attended in Europe and it was awesome to see
the kind of energy and the vibrant community of Ruby in Europe. 

Talks were very good with some great talks, i especially liked one
talk about Sentiment Analysis that was more about Machine Learning
than anything and i also liked Jose Valim's talk about how his pet
language helped him understand the design decisions of Ruby.

My talk went very good IMHO, it was basically explaining a concept
from functional programming, that appears a lot in the Clojure
community that is "The expression problem". Ruby has its own ways of
solving this issues, all of them suboptimal in my opinion. There was a
proposal from Matz to have traits, which are basically local-modules
in Ruby 2.0. It is not clear now if that will be the case for 2.0
because Matz is more focused in Ruby for embedded devices. I explained
all that and had time to give a small rant on why i think we as
programmers should step up our game.

So to sum up it was a great weekend in Germany and fun all
around. Snacks available every day at all times were awesome. Thanks
to El Cuervo (Bruno Aguirre) for the support. Kudos to the
organization team of Euroko Berlin 2011.
