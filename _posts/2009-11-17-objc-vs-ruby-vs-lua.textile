We say that Lua is an extensible extension language [30]. It is an extension language because it helps to extend ap- plications through configuration, macros, and other end-user customizations. Lua is designed to be embedded into a host application so that users can control how the application be- haves by writing Lua programs that access application ser- vices and manipulate application data. It is extensible be- cause it offers userdata values to hold application data and extensible semantics mechanisms to manipulate these values in natural ways. Lua is provided as a small core that can be extended with user functions written in both Lua and C. In particular, input and output, string manipulation, mathema- tical functions, and interfaces to the operating system are all provided as external libraries
