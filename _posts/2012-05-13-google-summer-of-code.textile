This year I decided to apply for doing Google Summer of Code and got accpeted to develop a Machine Learning libray for the amazing Storm by Nathan Marz. So the idea is to invesitgate and develop certain learning algorithms for stream learning.

Adaptative learning algorithms (ALAs) us a topic currently under heavy research, so this should be an interesting to say the least. What are ADAs ? ADAs are basically Incremental Learning algorithms that are able to handle Concept Drift. Concept Drift (CD) is basically the concept that as times passes the inherent properties of what you are model change and your model becomes more inaccurate.

This might be one of the biggest challanges in building this library but there are others even more fundamental and that I should tackle from the beginning. Maybe the biggest one is that as data from streams arrives you should deal with it in a distributed way and maybe with some limatiation in the amount of resources you have for learning calculations.

For the distributed issue we should be abla to tackle the capabilities of Storm to help us distribute the workload in a cluster, for the latter issue. we will start by developing certain algorithms for dealing with sketches of data. Sketches are summaries of data that will let us represent linear data coming from a stream in a sublinear way.

Sketches are statistcal data structures designed to summarize  properties of the data. These properties can the be queried for questions like : How many times have you seen this particular piece of data ? And sketches will return a meaningful answer  within a customizable probability of returning an error below certain error threshold (also customizable).

The first Sketch I want to implement is the CountMin sketch...
